This is a calculator built using a tutorial made by Madars Biss - https://www.sitepoint.com/react-tutorial-build-calculator-app/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=spw-37&utm_source=sitepoint-weekly.

The following features were implented:
- add, subtract, multiply, divide
- support decimal values
- calculate percentages
- invert values
- reset functionality
- format larger numbers
- output resize based on length

I also used Figma to create the wireframe for the app.
